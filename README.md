# File Metadata Microservice

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/file-metadata-microservice).

## Functionality

This is the [File Metadata Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice) project, where I make an API that accepts an uploaded file as input, and returns some of that file's metadata as JSON output.

## Thoughts

Tbd...

God bless.
